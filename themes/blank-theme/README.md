# The Blank Theme

This theme is not intended to be used directly. Instead, **instance projects** should copy this folder into their own theme and customize from there.

# Steps
  * Choose your project's theme name and copy the contents of this folder into **themes/your-name**
  * Edit **mutua.instance-project.config.ts** and change:
    * the theme name
    * the desired predefined modules to be included
    * the sample components
  * Copy the HTMLs and SCSS files, as long as the needed assets, from the themes used to test the modules
